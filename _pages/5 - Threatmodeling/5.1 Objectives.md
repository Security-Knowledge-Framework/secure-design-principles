Threat modeling is a family of activities for improving security by identifying threats, 
and then defining countermeasures to prevent, or mitigate the effects of, threats to the system. 
A threat is a potential or actual undesirable event that may be malicious (such as DoS attack) 
or incidental (failure of a StorageDevice). Threat modeling is a planned activity for 
identifying and assessing application threats and vulnerabilities.

Done right, threat modeling provides a clear "line of sight" across a project that justifies security efforts. The threat model allows security decisions to be made rationally, with all the information on the table.

The threat modeling process naturally produces an assurance argument that can be used to explain and defend the security of an application. An assurance argument starts with a few high level claims, and justifies them with either subclaims or evidence.

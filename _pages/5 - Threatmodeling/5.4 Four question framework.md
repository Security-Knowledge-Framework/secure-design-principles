A possible threat exists when the combined likelihood of the threat occurring and impact it would have on the organization create a significant risk. The following four question framework can help to organize threat modeling:

  - What are we working on?

  - What can go wrong?

  - What are we going to do about it?

  - Did we do a good job?

There are many methods or techniques that can be used to answer each of these questions. There is no "right" way to evaluate the search space of possible threats, but structured models exist in order to help make the process more efficient.

Attempting to evaluate all the possible combinations of threat agent, attack, vulnerability, and impact is often a waste of time and effort. It is helpful to refine the search space in order to determine which possible threats to focus on.

* Assess Scope  - What are we working on? This might be as small as a sprint, or as large as a whole system.

* Identify what can go wrong - This can be as simple as a brainstorm, or as structured as using STRIDE, Kill Chains, or Attack Trees.

* Identify countermeasures or manage risk - Decide what you're going to do about each threat. That might be to implement a mitigation, or to apply the accept/transfer/eliminate approaches of risk management.

* Assess your work - Did you do a good enough job for the system at hand?

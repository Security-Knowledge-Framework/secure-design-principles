Threat modeling is best applied continuously throughout a software development project. The process is essentially the same at different levels of abstraction, although the information gets more and more granular throughout the lifecycle. Ideally, a high-level threat model should be defined early on in the concept or planning phase, and then refined throughout the lifecycle. As more details are added to the system, new attack vectors are created and exposed. The ongoing threat modeling process should examine, diagnose, and address these threats.

It is a natural part of refining a system for new threats to be exposed. For example, when you select a particular technology -- such as Java for example -- you take on the responsibility of identifying the new threats that are created by that choice. Even implementation choices such as using regular expressions for validation can introduce potential new threats to deal with.

Updating threat models is advisable after events such as:

- A new feature is released
- Security incident occurs
- Architectural or infrastructure changes

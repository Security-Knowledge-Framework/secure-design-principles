Length checking is an important aspect of software security. It involves setting a maximum limit on the number of characters a variable can contain, known as the "length" of the variable. This technique ensures that the variable is only accepting the expected amount of data, preventing the input of unexpected, large amounts of data which could potentially cause security vulnerabilities.

For example, if a user input field is only meant to accept a single word, a length check can be used to limit the number of characters the field can contain to prevent malicious input such as a long string of code. By enforcing length restrictions, the risk of attacks such as buffer overflows is reduced. Length checking is a simple yet effective method to enhance the security of an information system.

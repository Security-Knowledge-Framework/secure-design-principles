A common mistake is the insecure handling of references to objects such as files, database rows, or other internal resources. Developers often assume that users will not alter or guess the references, leading to security designs that rely on obscurity rather than robust authorization. This mistake can expose sensitive information or critical functionalities to unauthorized users, creating a significant security risk.

Here's an example of a Python Flask application that is vulnerable to IDOR:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import sqlite3

app = Flask(__name__)

def get_user_details(user_id):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", (user_id,))
    user_details = cursor.fetchone()
    conn.close()
    return user_details

@app.route('/profile')
def profile():
    user_id = request.args.get('id')
    user_details = get_user_details(user_id)
    if user_details:
        return jsonify(user_details)
    else:
        return "User not found", 404

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

n the above code, the function get_user_details takes a user ID from the query parameters and directly uses it in a database query without validation. An attacker could modify the id parameter in the URL (e.g., `http://example.com/profile?id=2`) to access another user's details. This vulnerability arises because the application does not verify whether the logged-in user is authorized to view the requested profile, nor does it sanitize or validate the user_id input for type, format, or bounds.

This chapter will focus on identifying such coding practices that lead to IDOR, providing practical coding examples and discussing strategies to prevent these vulnerabilities from being introduced into codebases.

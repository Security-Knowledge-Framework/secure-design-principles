Consider a Python Flask application snippet where a user ID from a URL parameter is used directly to fetch user profile information:

```python
@app.route('/user/<int:user_id>')
def get_user_profile(user_id):
    # Directly using user_id from URL parameter
    profile = db.get_profile(user_id)
    return jsonify(profile)
```

In this example, the application does not verify whether the authenticated user is authorized to access the specified user profile. This leads to an IDOR vulnerability as any authenticated user can access any profile by simply changing the user_id in the URL.

Here's another common scenario in a web application that allows users to download files based on a filename parameter:

```python
@app.route('/download')
def download_file():
    filename = request.args.get('filename')
    return send_from_directory('uploads', filename)
```

This code is vulnerable to IDOR because it does not check if the requesting user is authorized to access the file referred to by filename. An attacker could potentially access sensitive files by manipulating the filename parameter.

To mitigate such IDOR vulnerabilities, it's crucial to implement reflective access control checks. Hereâ€™s how you could improve the previous examples:

**Improved user fetch**

```python
@app.route('/user')
def get_user_profile():
    profile = db.get_profile(current_user.id)
    return jsonify(profile)
```
By removing any user-supplied input for fetching sensitive data (such as user profiles), this code pattern prevents attackers from attempting to manipulate or guess user IDs. The current_user.id is typically set during the authentication process and is managed by the server session, which is much harder to tamper with compared to URL or form parameters.

**Improved File Download:**

```python
@app.route('/download')
def download_file():
    filename = request.args.get('filename')
    if not user_authorized_to_access(filename, current_user):
        abort(403)  # Prevents access if the user is not authorized
    return send_from_directory('uploads', filename)
```

This improved code includes a function user_authorized_to_access, which checks whether the logged-in user has the rights to access the file. This function would involve checking a database or another data source to confirm authorization, effectively mitigating the IDOR vulnerability.

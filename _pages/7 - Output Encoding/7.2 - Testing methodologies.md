To detect Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities effectively, a combination of static analysis (SAST), dynamic analysis (DAST), and manual verification is essential. Each approach uncovers different aspects of the attack surface, and using them together provides both breadth and depth. Below is a breakdown of how to approach XSS testing across modern and legacy stacks using tools like Semgrep, GREP, OWASP ZAP, and manual inspection.

### SAST
Static Application Security Testing (SAST) analyzes an application's source code, bytecode, or binaries without executing the program. It identifies security vulnerabilities by scanning for insecure coding patterns, tainted data flows, and dangerous API usage. Because it inspects code statically, SAST can detect issues early in the development lifecycle—before the application is even deployed. It’s especially effective at finding input handling flaws like XSS when data flows from user-controlled input (sources) to dangerous rendering functions (sinks) without proper validation or encoding.

Below is shown some GREP examples which are ofcourse oversimplified for other SAST tools, but it serves the idea of what the tools look out for in most cases.

**JavaScript:**
Look for dangerous sinks:
```bash
    grep -r --include=*.js 'innerHTML\s*=' .
    grep -r --include=*.js 'outerHTML\s*=' .
    grep -r --include=*.js 'document\.write' .
    grep -r --include=*.js 'document\.writeln' .
    grep -r --include=*.js 'eval\s*\(' .
    grep -r --include=*.js 'setTimeout\s*\(.*string' .
    grep -r --include=*.js 'setInterval\s*\(.*string' .
```

**JQUERY:**
```bash
    grep -r --include=*.js '\.html\s*\(' .
    grep -r --include=*.js '\.append\s*\(' .
    grep -r --include=*.js '\.prepend\s*\(' .
    grep -r --include=*.js '\.after\s*\(' .
    grep -r --include=*.js '\.before\s*\(' .
    grep -r --include=*.js '\.replaceWith\s*\(' .
    grep -r --include=*.js '\.attr\s*\(.*(src|href|on.*)' .
```

**React/JSX:**

```bash
grep -r --include=*.js 'dangerouslySetInnerHTML' .
```


### DAST
Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) examines a running application from the outside in, simulating how an attacker would interact with it in real time. It sends crafted input to endpoints and observes how the application responds, looking for things like reflected scripts, unescaped content, or client-side behavior that exposes vulnerabilities. DAST doesn’t require access to source code and is ideal for catching XSS in production-like environments, especially when input is only dangerous under certain runtime conditions (e.g., browser rendering, async components, or dynamic templates).

OWASP ZAP is a example of a powerful dynamic testing tool that simulates real-world attacks by fuzzing and intercepting live traffic. It helps uncover XSS when the application is actually running and rendering user-supplied data.

How to use it for XSS:

- Spider the target — Crawl the entire app to map endpoints and parameters.
- Active Scan — Use ZAP’s active scanner to automatically inject XSS payloads into input fields, headers, cookies, etc.
- Custom Payloads — Add context-aware test strings like:

`<script>alert(1)</script>`

`"><svg/onload=alert(1)>`

`javascript:alert(1)`

- Look at reflected content 

ZAP shows where input is reflected unencoded. CSP and HTTP headers are also checked by ZAP to see if they are are missing or misconfigured. more information about ZAP can be found here: https://www.zaproxy.org/

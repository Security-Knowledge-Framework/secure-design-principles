XSS attacks can occur in various browser rendering contexts, not just within HTML body content. Below is a breakdown of key contexts, how attackers exploit them, and example payloads:

### HTML Attribute Context
When user input is placed inside attributes like src, alt, title, or data-*, it must be encoded for attribute context. Failing to do so allows an attacker to break out of the attribute and inject a script.

Example payload: `"><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`

Risk: Executes JavaScript by closing the attribute and injecting an image tag with an onerror handler.

### href and URL Context
Input injected into href attributes is dangerous if the application doesn't validate the scheme (e.g., http, https). Attackers can inject javascript: URLs or abuse malformed anchors.

Example payload: href="`javascript:alert(1)`"

Risk: Clicking the link executes JavaScript. This is especially risky in legacy browsers or when CSP is missing or misconfigured.

### Attribute Injection Context
User input placed inside arbitrary HTML attributes—especially custom attributes or event handler-like ones (e.g., onmouseover, onload)—can be exploited if not properly sanitized. This often happens when developers dynamically generate attributes or styles based on user input without encoding for attribute context.

Example payload: style="color:red" `onmouseover="alert(1)`"

Risk: The injected event handler is executed as soon as the user hovers over the element. This bypasses typical script tags and can occur even in seemingly "safe" places like tooltips, custom components, or data-driven attributes.

### Script Injection
If input lands inside a `<script>` block or inline event handlers like onclick, attackers can escape from a quoted string or context to run arbitrary code.

Example payload: `');alert(1)//`

Risk: Closes an open string or statement in JavaScript, then appends attacker-controlled script.

### Style Injection (CSS Context)
Less common but still exploitable: user input injected into a <style> tag or style="..." attribute can be abused to perform attacks like history sniffing or browser-based side-channel attacks.

Example payload: `body{background:url('javascript:alert(1)')}`

Risk: In some browsers, URLs in CSS can trigger JavaScript execution.

### Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI)
Modern front-end frameworks (like Angular, Vue, or Handlebars) use client-side templates. If user input is interpreted instead of safely rendered, attackers can inject logic that executes within the client’s JavaScript engine.

Example payload: `{{constructor.constructor('alert(1)')()}}`

Risk: Executes code if the templating engine evaluates logic instead of rendering it as a string (sandbox escape).

Key Takeaway:
Different browser contexts interpret input differently. It’s not enough to validate input—you must also encode it correctly for the output context (HTML, attribute, JavaScript, URL, CSS, or template) to prevent XSS. Misplaced trust in “clean input” is one of the most dangerous assumptions in secure development.

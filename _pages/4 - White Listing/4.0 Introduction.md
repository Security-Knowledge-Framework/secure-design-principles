As you can already tell, the deny-listing approach becomes a cat-and-mouse game fairly quickly and is therefore not a recommended approach to go about. Deny-listing, or maintaining a list of forbidden items, can be an inadequate approach to software security for several reasons:

- **Maintenance:** Deny-lists need to be constantly updated to reflect the latest threats, making them a maintenance-intensive approach.
- **Incomplete coverage:** New security threats can arise and the deny-list may not have entries for these, making the system vulnerable.
- **False positives:** Sometimes, legitimate input may be accidentally blocked by the deny-list.
- **Easy to bypass:** Attackers can easily evade deny-lists by simply changing their attack vectors, making them an easily bypassable security measure.

In summary, deny-lists can be difficult to maintain, provide incomplete coverage, lead to false positives, and can be easily bypassed by attackers. It is recommended to use other security measures such as allow-listing, input validation, and least privilege instead of solely relying on deny-lists for security.

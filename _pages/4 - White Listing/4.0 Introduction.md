An allow-list, also known as a whitelist or passlist, is a crucial mechanism in ensuring the security of an application. By default, it denies all entities access to specific privileges, services, or recognition, but allows a pre-determined and explicitly identified set of entities.

In the context of software development and application security, an allow-list serves the same purpose but with a different implementation. Consider the example of a directory traversal vulnerability and the Local File Inclusion (LFI) attack that was previously mentioned in the introduction. Implementing an allow-list helps to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information and resources, as well as the exploitation of security vulnerabilities. By explicitly specifying which entities are allowed, an allow-list helps to increase the overall security of the application and reduce the risk of potential attacks.

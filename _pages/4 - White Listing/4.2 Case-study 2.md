```python
@app.route("/home", methods=['POST'])
def home():
    filename = request.form['filename']
    if filename == "":
        filename = "default.txt"
    f = open(filename, 'r')
    read = f.read()
    return render_template("index.html", read=read)
```

We want to take control away from an attacker. Let's assume in this situation there is only but a subset of text files the person should be able to read from the server. Then we could simply define these file names in an _array_ or a l_ist_ and check if they match the user input.

```python
@app.route("/home", methods=['POST'])
def home():
    filename = isAllowed(request.form['filename'])
    content = readFileContent(filename)
    return render_template("index.html", read=content)

def isAllowed(filename):
    list = ["default.txt", "intro.txt", "other-text.txt"]
    return "default.txt" if not filename in list else filename

def readFileContent(filename):
    f = open(filename, 'r')
    read = f.read()
    f.close()
    return read
```

As you can see from the new example, we check the filename against a pre-defined subset of filenames to verify if the input that comes into the application is allowed to get into the file read operator. If the input does not match the whitelist we default to a default value namely default.txt.

The white list approach is the opposite of using a blacklist, which is a list of things denied when everything is allowed by default.

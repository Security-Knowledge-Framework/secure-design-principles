Blacklisting is an overall discouraged strategy. This has to do with the fact that for every "filter" you introduce in the application, hackers will find smart bypasses around them to exploit your application still.

Example, before there were standard libraries to prevent [XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) developers created filters (blacklists) to prevent this attack. They started with matching on `<script>` tags and reject input if the pattern was matched by the blacklist. Now, hackers were smart and tried to inject `<ScripT>` and bypassed the filter. After which developers would normalize input to lowercase and pattern matched to prevent the hacker's last iteration of injecting script tags into the application. By then hackers found another bypass for the normalization and started to use javascript event handlers to achieve their goal such as `<h1 onload='alert("XSS")'>HACK</h1>`.

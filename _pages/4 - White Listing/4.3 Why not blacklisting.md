Deny-listing is an overall discouraged strategy. This has to do with the fact that for every "filter" you introduce in the application, hackers will still find smart bypasses around them to exploit your application.

For example, before there were standard libraries to prevent [XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) developers created filters (deny-lists) to prevent this attack. They started with matching on `<script>` tags and rejected input if the pattern was matched by the deny-list. Now, hackers were smart and tried to inject `<ScripT>` and bypassed the filter. After which developers would normalize input to lowercase and pattern match to prevent the hacker's last iteration of injecting script tags into the application. By then hackers found another bypass for the normalization and started to use JavaScript event handlers to achieve their goal such as `<h1 onload='alert("XSS")'>HACK</h1>`.

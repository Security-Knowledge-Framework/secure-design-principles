The previous example was a bit easier and straightforward so let's take another one. So, instead of checking a simple type such as "float, string, number, etc" we could also verify more "structured text formats" such as:

- Date of birth
- Phone number
- Credit card number
- email address
- Alphanumeric string
- etc

```python
# Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, EmailStr

class MyPydanticModel(BaseModel):
    email: EmailStr = Field(..., max_length=5)
```

```python
# Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations
from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError, validator

class UserModel(BaseModel):
    username: str

    @validator('username')
    def username_alphanumeric(cls, v):
        assert v.isalnum(), 'must be alphanumeric'
        return v
```

Now, these examples lean very heavily on python's pydantic library. But each programming language should have a similar type of solution where you can create a centralized approach for checking and testing the types of input that you expect on your models.

In conclusion, type-checking and validations are important aspects of secure software development. They helps to prevent security vulnerabilities by ensuring that the input received by the application meets the expected format and structure and that the values of these inputs are semantically valid in the specific context of the application.

By implementing type-checking and/or validation, developers can catch and reject unauthorized inputs early in the execution flow, reducing the risk of exploitation by attackers and ensuring the security and stability of the application.

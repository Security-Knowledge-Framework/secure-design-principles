Input validation is a critical aspect of software security that aims to prevent malicious data from being processed within a system. This process ensures that only properly formatted data is accepted and entered into the workflow, thereby avoiding the possibility of malformed data being stored in the database and causing downstream components to malfunction.

Input validation is typically performed as soon as data is received from external sources or users, and it should not be relied upon as the primary method of protection against attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or SQL Injection. However, it can help to minimize the impact of these attacks when properly implemented.

  
**Input Validation is your first line of defense!**

Input validation is crucial in software development for security purposes because user input is often the entry point for malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities in an application. By validating user input, a developer can ensure that the data entered into the application conforms to the expected format and does not contain any malicious content that could potentially harm the system.

User input can originate from various sources, such as text fields in a form, selections from a drop-down menu, uploaded files, or actions performed in a GUI. It's important to validate user input from all sources to prevent security risks.

In summary, input validation is important for software security because it helps to protect the application from malicious user input, which could be used to exploit vulnerabilities and compromise the system.

User input refers to data that is entered into a software application by an end-user. This can include anything from text typed into a form field, to a selection made from a drop-down list, to an uploaded file, or even an action performed in a graphical user interface (GUI) such as clicking a button. User input is considered to be any data that originates from outside of the software application and is provided as input to the application for processing.

It's important to consider user input in the context of software development and security because user input can pose security risks if not properly validated and sanitized. For example, if user input is allowed to directly control a database query or execute code, it may be possible for an attacker to inject malicious code into the application and compromise the system. To mitigate these risks, it's important to validate user input and ensure that it conforms to the expected format and is free of malicious content. This is commonly referred to as input validation or input sanitization.

There are three primary strategies for input validation

- Type Checking
- Whitelisting
- Length Checking

These strategies are important because, without proper input validation, attackers can inject malicious data into a system and cause security vulnerabilities, such as Local File Inclusion/Directory Traversal attacks. We will highlight each strategy and give hands-on examples of different attacks if these strategies are not implemented correctly. These examples also give you guidance on how specific input validation strategies would have mitigated the attacks demonstrated.

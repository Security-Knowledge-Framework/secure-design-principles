# Secure Design Principles for Software Development

Welcome to the Secure Design Principles for Software Development. This guide is designed to give developers a practical and easy-to-implement blueprint to jumpstart secure software development practices. By focusing on key principles, developers can mitigate a significant number of vulnerabilities, including those related to injection and IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References).

## Overview

This repository provides a structured guide on key secure design principles, including whitelisting, type checking, length checking, threat modeling, and addressing authorization flaws. Each section is crafted to be straightforward, providing developers with clear guidance on how to integrate these practices into their coding processes effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the secure design principles, ensure the following:
- **Development Environment Setup:** You should have a basic development environment set up for code experimentation and testing.
- **Basic Understanding of Application Security:** Some familiarity with application security concepts will be beneficial, though the guide is designed to be accessible to beginners.

## Secure Design Principles

### Whitelisting
Learn how to implement effective whitelisting mechanisms in your applications, which are crucial for controlling what types of inputs or behaviors are permitted, thereby reducing the risk of unwanted or malicious data processing.

### Type Checking
Understand the importance of type checking in your code to prevent type-related errors and vulnerabilities, particularly those that can be exploited through injection attacks.

### Length Checking
Discover how to implement length checking to ensure that inputs do not exceed expected bounds, which can protect your applications from various forms of overflow attacks.

### Threat Modeling
Explore basic threat modeling practices to systematically analyze the security of your applications. This section helps you identify potential security issues before they can be exploited.

### IDOR (Authorization Flaws)
Gain insights into common authorization flaws like IDOR, and learn strategies to ensure robust authorization checks that confirm a userâ€™s rights to access or modify resources.

## Target Audience

This guide is specifically crafted for:
- **Developers**: Focused on those new to security or looking to enhance their understanding of secure coding practices.
- **Security Champions**: Developers who are tasked with leading security initiatives within their teams.
